# Project Title:
1. WHO(World Health Organization).
2. Viatours.


## Introduction:
  This is a "ConstructWeek" project made by a team of four members within a span of five days. 
  The objective is to test and apply the coding and testing skills that we learned during our journey at Masai School.
  My team members are Junaid, Babu Reddy, Sourabh Rawat and Akhil Negi.

  We clone WHO because of it promotes the health and awareness on global stage, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends and outcomes worldwide.
  and also We cloned Viatour, which provides affordable travel trips, making it easy to navigate to destinations.

## Project title:
1. WHO(World Health Organization).
2. Viatours.


## Introduction:
  This is a "ConstructWeek" project made by a team of four members within five days. 
  The objective is to test and apply the coding and testing skills that we learned during our journey at Masai School.

  We clone WHO because it promotes health and awareness on the global stage, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends and outcomes worldwide.
  also, We cloned Viatour, which provides affordable travel trips, making it easy to navigate to destinations.
